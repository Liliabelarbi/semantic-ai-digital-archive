# Proposal: Semantic AI for Enhanced Metadata Creation and Curation  
## A Comparative Study of Metadata Practices in Digital Archives

---

###  Rationale for Developing the System

**Definition of the User Group:**  
Our target users are digital archivists, librarians, researchers in metadata science, and institutions managing digital archives.

**Information Needs:**  
- Consistent metadata structures
- Enhanced metadata creation using AI
- Easy access to historical metadata formats for comparison

**Gaps in Existing Systems:**  
- Lack of intelligent metadata automation tools
- Difficulty accessing and comparing diverse metadata formats
- Limited interoperability across older and newer archives

---

###  Evaluation Criteria with Use Cases

1. **Use Case 1**: A digital librarian uploads scanned images of old metadata cards and uses AI to generate modern metadata tags.
2. **Use Case 2**: A metadata researcher compares the effectiveness of different metadata standards.
3. **Use Case 3**: A university student uses the system to understand how metadata evolved from physical to digital.

###  System Objectives

- Allow flexible metadata ingestion (image, document, report)
- Use semantic AI tools for enhancing metadata
- Provide searchable and organized access to files for education and research

---

###  System Specifications

- Platform: GitHub (public repository)
- Folder hierarchy with semantic organization
- Metadata documented in Markdown (`.md`) for portability and readability
- Public and accessible version for researchers to fork, reuse, or contribute

---

###  Development Plan

**Step 1:** Create a folder hierarchy  
**Step 2:** Ingest 5 sample metadata items  
**Step 3:** Create standardized metadata in Markdown format  
**Step 4:** Organize into collections and exhibits  
**Step 5:** Add README and documentation  
**Step 6:** Publish and share repository

---

###  Field Testing

- Share with classmates and peers
- Gather feedback from metadata professionals
- Test ease of reuse, search, and citation

---

###  Timetable

| Week | Task |
|------|------|
| 1 | Create GitHub repo, folder structure |
| 2 | Add metadata content and commit items |
| 3 | Write proposal and documentation |
| 4 | Peer review and update |
| 5 | Finalize presentation and public version |

---

###  Skills Needed

- GitHub proficiency  
- Basic Markdown formatting  
- Metadata standards knowledge  
- Communication and feedback collection
